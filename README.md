# GPU-based cores for spark-based graph processing system

This project is part of another project "spark-based graph processing system". However, it also can be run independently by executing several test programs built in.

The purpose of this project is to fully utilize the computing ability of emerging hardware and to accelerate heavy computation tasks such graph processing for distributed system, as well as to achieve well-behaved workload balancing and task scheduling for GPU processing kernel by using managers built in distributed system.

## System Requirement

A suitable C++14 compiler is necessary (such as clang, g++-5 and so on)

Also, you still need a cmake with version newer than 3.9 to compile it easily, but it's no matter whether you use cmake or not.

For those components which are relative to GPU, a CUDA runtime environment which version is upper 8.0 is needed.

For srv part, System V-supported environment(namely, UNIX-like system) is needed for normal build process.

## Config

There are few things to be configured when using this core. Although, if you want to specify some GPU runtime parameter, please check GPUconfig.h in {project_path}/include.

## Installation

This project includes a simple script for UNIX-like system to compile automatically. Just run the autoBuild.sh in {project_path}

```
./autoBuild.sh
```

and you will find executables in {project_path}/build/bin

Also, you can compile this project manually but easily by following standard instructions of compiling a cmake-based project. A example for this can be showed as follows.

```
cd {project_path}
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$procs
```

## Usage

After compilation, you will find some executables under the directory {project_path}/build/bin, which provide several test examples for our Graph_Algo library. The followed part shows How-To for using these test examples.

Be careful, some tests needs a input Graph file called testGraph.txt in {project_path}/build/bin which can be generated by tool_RandGraphGen by passing proper parameters.

### algo_xxxTest

When executing algo_xxxTest, file testGraph.txt must be needed. GPUTests can only be generated and executed when CUDA runtime detected in system environment.

None of those tests needs parameters to launch. They will search for necessary parameters for initialization from testGraph.txt instead.

### srv_UtilxxxTest

Since this srv library is written by using system V, one can only compile this library and run tests related to this library on UNIX-like system. 

Also, one may need to change system parameters "kern.sysv.xxx" to appropriate values for normal execution. (Some systems such as OSX sets those parameters to unbelievably small values which significantly obstruct System V-dependent applications to execute normally)

srv_UtilServerTest_xxx doesn't need any input file to launch, but still takes some time to initialize, especially in GPU version. srv_UtilClientTest, however, needs input file testGraph.txt to launch.

Both srv_UtilxxxTest needs proper parameters to launch, which will be shown as usage info by passing wrong parameters into these tests. 

For those who feel troublesome to input parameters for srv_UtilxxxTest, you can look at {project_path}/test directory for pre-built test scripts for srv_UtilxxxTest, which needs a testGraph.txt generated with vCount = 100k & eCount = 2m, and generated 4 servers & clients by default.
